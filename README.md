Program for CSCI 2270, same BST with expanded functionality and JSON logging

Writeup provided by course.
Primarily just an expansion on the previous program, which is really just turning out to be an
experiment by the graders to see if json logging can work for grading. 
https://github.com/json-c/json-c is the library of choice for this and I am slowly learning the
effing pains of linking a library that does not want to cooperate. It is packaged in the fedora
repo already, but it refuses to link a library and only installs header files, which leads me to
believe that I am doing something stupid and it is really a simple thing. In deb/ubun it links
easily, without problem. The issue is that I care little for using a VM on a laptop. Little to 
absolutely nothing.
